Effective December 21, 2020, we adopted a code of ethics that applies to all of our executive officers, directors, and employees. The code of ethics codifies the business and ethical principles that govern all aspects of our business. Our code of ethics was publicly filed as an exhibit to our Registration Statement that became effective on December 21, 2020 and can be found on the SEC EDGAR website. A copy of the Code of Ethics will be provided without charge upon request from us. We intend to disclose any amendments to or waivers of certain provisions of our Code of Ethics in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
